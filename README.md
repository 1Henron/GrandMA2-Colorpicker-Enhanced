# GrandMA2 Colorpicker Enhanced

A GrandMA 2 Colorpicker that's easy to use and install.

## Credit
All credit for the picker itself goes to [Ethan Benjamin](https://www.youtube.com/c/EthanBenjamin) and this [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhYDUzWKz3M&t=184s). I merely made it simpler to install and added an FX Picker.

## How to install
1. Put all files in their respective folder in MA2 to import them. (f.e. put the Macros in the Macro folder. ```Colorpicker0.9.xml``` belongs in the ```importexport``` folder.)
2. In GrandMA 2 import the macros as they're labeled.
3. Run the **```1COLPRESET CREATOR```** Macro. The first Popup is purely informative, it can be skipped. 
Enter Groups in the second popup Make sure that you include **one group of each color-mixing method**. You can use ```+``` and ```thru```. Also, make sure that color presets ```1 thru 12``` and ```100 + 101``` are empty.
4. Run the **```2Platzhalter erstellen```**  Macro.
5. __Import Images__. 
- Right-click on Image pool Item 17 and import all images from the "Unfilled" Folder. They should be in the right order, but you should double-check. The order is: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C.
- Now import the Filled Images at Image pool Item 33 using the same method.
6. NOw run the **```3IMAGEVARIABLEFIXER```** Macro.
6. Now run the **```4Image Copier```** Macro. The Popup can be ignored and skipped.
8. Now run the **```5 Layout import```** Macro.
